# Unit-Testing-Codelab
A codelab created for demonstrating unit testing in C# and Obj-C.

### Before we hop into the code...
You will need to install Git on your machine. 

###### For Windows users
Go to [This Link](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to download the Git installer.
When going through the install process, make sure you add Git to the Windows Command Prompt (everything is much easier that way)

###### For Mac users
Go to [This Link](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) to download the Git for Mac installer.
You shouldn't need to do anything else after it finishes, just enjoy all that Git Goodness!

###### For all users
Once you have finished installing Git, go to your main command line app (CMD for Windows, Terminal for Mac) and type git.
If you see a bunch of lines of text pop, it has been installed correctly, else you may need to install again.

Now that we've got that out of the way, we can finally start!

### Unit testing for C#?
All you C#'ers should check out [This Page](https://github.com/Weava/Unit-Testing-Codelab/tree/csharp) to get started on the C# Unit Testing Codelab.

### Unit testing for Obj-C?
I don't envy you, but it must be done. Check out [This Page](https://github.com/Weava/Unit-Testing-Codelab/tree/objc) to get started on the Objective-C Unit Testing Codelab.
